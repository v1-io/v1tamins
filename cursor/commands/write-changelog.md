# Write Changelog

## Overview

Write a changelog for recent changes.

## Steps

1. Check the docs/internal/changelog folder for the latest changelog (they are dated in the filename).
2. Check github for all the PRs that have been merged to main since the latest changelog file.
3. Write a new changelog file with the new changes.

## Changelog Content & Format
- The changelog should be a markdown file.
- The changelog should be in the following format:
  - Select the 1-3 most impactful changes, focusing on user-facing changes and new features.
  - For each change, include the following:
    - title: 1-3 words describing the change (heading 2)
    - description: 1-2 sentences describing the change (paragraph)
    - placeholder for a visual
  - If there are lots of smaller changes, summarize them at the end with a few high level bullets
